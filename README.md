## Devlog
The scene is the world that our character lives in. Gameobjects are empty husks of a body, they are hollow. Gameobjects need substance like a unique appearance and a purpose to exist. Components provide the gameobject its physical form, along with its ability to move and function. Components are essentially the brains that send rules for the gameobject to follow.
